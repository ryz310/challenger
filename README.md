If you introduce [`rubocop`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) to an existing Rails project later, you will use [`$ rubocop --auto-gen-config`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/configuration.md#automatically-generated-configuration). But it will make a huge `.rubocop_todo.yml` and make you despair.
On the other hand, `rubocop` has [`--auto-correct`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/basic_usage.md#other-useful-command-line-flags) option, it is possible to automatically repair the writing which does not conform to the rule. But since it occasionally destroys your code, it is quite dangerous to apply all at once.
It is ideal that to remove a disabled rule from `.rubocop_todo.yml` every day, to check whether it passes test, and can be obtained consent from the team. But it requires strong persistence and time.
I call such work *Rubocop Challenge*. And the *RubocopChallenger* is a gem to support this challenge!

## The history of RubocopChallenger with decrease of offence codes

The following chart shows the history of RubocopChallenger and decrease of offence codes at a `.rubocop_todo.yml`. The project was released at 5 years ago, and then it was introduced the RuboCop gem for huge source code including a lots of offence codes. Before using the RubocopChallenger, it was not maintain to reduce offence codes. One day, I felt a crisis and started maintain with manual. I made a lots of Pull Requests to reduce them but it's a load for me and reviewers. So I created a script for automation the flow, which is the predecessor of Rubocop Challenger gem. It brought reducing the offence codes continuously. After 8 months, finally it has done. There is no auto-correctable offence codes.
But there are many offences which is un-auto-correctable yet. I will try to reduce it with the RubocopChallenger. The RubocopChallenger will
be continued to evolve.

## Rubocop Challenge Flow

1. Run *RubocopChallenger* periodically from CI tool etc.
1. When *RubocopChallenger* starts, delete a disabled rule from `.rubocop_todo.yml` existing in your project, execute `$ rubocop --auto-correct` and create a PR which include modified results
1. You confirm the PR passes testing and then merge it if there is no problem
