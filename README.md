If you introduce [`rubocop`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) to an existing Rails project later, you will use [`$ rubocop --auto-gen-config`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/configuration.md#automatically-generated-configuration). But it will make a huge `.rubocop_todo.yml` and make you despair.
On the other hand, `rubocop` has [`--autocorrect`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/basic_usage.md#other-useful-command-line-flags) option, it is possible to automatically repair the writing which does not conform to the rule. But since it occasionally destroys your code, it is quite dangerous to apply all at once.
It is ideal that to remove a disabled rule from `.rubocop_todo.yml` every day, to check whether it passes test, and can be obtained consent from the team. But it requires strong persistence and time.
I call such work _Rubocop Challenge_. And the _RubocopChallenger_ is a gem to support this challenge!

## The history of RubocopChallenger with decrease of offense codes

The following chart shows the history of RubocopChallenger and decrease of offense codes at a `.rubocop_todo.yml`. The project was released at 5 years ago, and then it was introduced the RuboCop gem for huge source code including a lots of offense codes. Before using the RubocopChallenger, it was not maintain to reduce offense codes. One day, I felt a crisis and started maintain with manual. I made a lots of Pull Requests to reduce them but it's a load for me and reviewers. So I created a script for automation the flow, which is the predecessor of Rubocop Challenger gem. It brought reducing the offense codes continuously. After 8 months, finally it has done. There is no autocorrectable offense codes.
But there are many offenses which is un-autocorrectable yet. I will try to reduce it with the RubocopChallenger. The RubocopChallenger will
be continued to evolve.

## Rubocop Challenge Flow

1. Run _RubocopChallenger_ periodically from CI tool etc.
1. When _RubocopChallenger_ starts, delete a disabled rule from `.rubocop_todo.yml` existing in your project, execute `$ rubocop --autocorrect` and create a PR which include modified results
1. You confirm the PR passes testing and then merge it if there is no problem

## Usage

### 1. Configure .circleci/config.yml

Configure your `.circleci/config.yml` to run rubocop_challenger, for example:

```yml
# .circleci/config.yml
version: 2

jobs:
  rubocop_challenge:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:3.0
    working_directory: ~/repo
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Rubocop Challenge
          command: |
            gem install rubocop_challenger
            rubocop_challenger go \
              --email=rubocop-challenger@example.com \
              --name="Rubocop Challenger"

workflows:
  version: 2

  nightly:
    triggers:
      - schedule:
          cron: "30 23 * * 1,2,3" # 8:30am every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (JST)
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - master
    jobs:
      - rubocop_challenge
```

**Should not append `gem 'rubocop_challenger'` on your Gemfile.**
I have seen cases where errors occur due to compatibility issues with other gems.

### 2. Setting GitHub personal access token

GitHub personal access token is required for sending pull requests to your repository.

1. Go to [your account's settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and [generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with "repo" scope
   ![generate token](images/generate_token.png)
1. On [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) dashboard, go to your application's "Project Settings" -> "Environment Variables"
1. Add an environment variable `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your GitHub personal access token
   ![circleci environment variables](images/circleci_environment_variables.png)

### Want to use on GitHub Actions?

Here is a sample workflow:

```yml

    - cron: 0 17 * * 2,4

jobs:
  create-rubocop-challenger-pr:
    name: Create Rubocop Challenger Pull Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Set git configuration
        run: git config remote.origin.url "git@github.com:your_org/your_repo.git" 
      - name: Create RuboCop challenge pull request
        env:
          GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          gem install rubocop_challenger
          rubocop_challenger go --email="rubocop-challenger@example.com" --name="Rubocop Challenger" --mode=random --only-exclude
```

You will need to make sure the following setting is enabled by going to Settings -> Actions -> General and checking `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
